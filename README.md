# Garmin IQ Shorts weather widget

[https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/393125bc-d59a-49a8-b8d6-f51e35460a91](https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/393125bc-d59a-49a8-b8d6-f51e35460a91)

This is a basic widget for Garmin watches that shows whether or not it's shorts weather. The widget uses a proprietary algorithm (it really just checks if the temperature is above or equal to 17 degrees celcius) to determine if the weather is great for shorts or not.

Pull requests for new models/translations are more than welcome.
